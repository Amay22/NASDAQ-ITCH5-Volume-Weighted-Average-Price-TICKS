# NASDAQ-ITCH5-Volume-Weighted-Average-Price-TICKS
Parses NASDAQ ITCH 5 data and Calculates Volume Weighted average Price of all the Stock. 

Just provide the path of the NASDAQ ITCH 5.0 format file to FileInputStream("file-path\\file-name");

Note: path should look something like this "C:\\Users\\Amay\\Documents\\NetBeansProjects\\06022014.NASDAQ_ITCH50" with backslashes

It's a huge dataset like 6.5 GB huge so the program takes up a lot of resources. I have 8GB of RAM and it took 3.5 mins to build and execute so it'll take up a lot of time don't shut it off midway thinking that it's not running. No need to change anything much do anything the program will run and output the file directly in an HTML file.
